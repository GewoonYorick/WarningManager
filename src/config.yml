# Tips for editing YAML files:
#   - Do not use TABS! Instead use 4 spaces.
#   - Lines starting with '#' symbol are completely ignored
#   - Indentation matters
#   - If you have any errors, google 'yaml parser' to easily correct them

# Set the prefix of the plugin. This gets displayed on all messages sent through the plugin.
prefix: '&8[&6WarningManager&8] '

# Message that gets sent out when a player gets warned. Tags: %TARGET% %REASON% %SENDER%
broadcast-message: '&6Player &c%SENDER% &6has warned &c%PLAYER% &6for &c%REASON%'

# Reason that will be supplied when the reason argument is not full filled, optional tag is %punishment% which gets replaced with the punishment

# Auto command handler. Number is amount of warnings until the 'command' happens.
# Avaible tags are %PLAYER% %SENDER %REASON% %WARNINGS%
# Do not include the '/' at the begining of the command

# A new really cool feature called groups which lets you specify the type of warning and then have dynamic punishments based on that type
# Make a new group by forming 2 spaces, typing in the group name followed by a : (hit enter) then 4 spaces with the warning number and : (hit enter) command: then "" with the command inside it. Then do /wreload
# Follow the defaults for examples
